**I'm Sean Barton**, a skinny geeky kid that grew up in a small mining town in Canada but now lives and works in Austin, Texas with my wife, two daughters, and two dogs.
We are all Texan-Canadian hybrids now. Well, except for the dogs.

(Speaking of dogs, **can you do all our furry friends a favor**? Check out your [local animal shelters first](https://theshelterpetproject.org/) when looking for canine or feline companions. **Thanks!**)

**Why Seanba?** Well, it's one of the many nicknames that I've acquired over the years and the domain was available so here we are. Believe it or not, *SeanSeanTheLeprechaun.com* was already taken! :four_leaf_clover:

## My career

In 1999 I started my career as a game developer with the now-defunct [Digital Anvil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Anvil) 
which became part of the Microsoft Game Studios group.
I later worked for [NCsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSoft), 
[Spacetime Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime_Studios), 
and [Junction Point Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junction_Point_Studios) (part of Disney Interactive).

## Current job

I now serve as the lead developer at [22nd Century Toys](http://www.22ndcenturytoys.com/) - a small but really cool company I formed with other Disney alumni in 2013.
As a toymaker I get to work on a lot of fun AAA and indie titles. I think it's pretty neat that I get to work on games like Borderlands and Mafia III as well as
Night in the Woods and Enter the Gungeon. It's a nice range.

## When I'm not working

I enjoy programming so I tend to do that a lot during my free time. I grew up in the 80s so I consume a lot of entertainment from that excellent decade.
I love [The Transformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_Generation_1) and [Depeche Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depeche_Mode).

Of course I also love video games but these days I play mostly retro and indie titles.
Like many people my age with a career and family it's challenging to find time for many AAA games. I make exceptions for the Marios and Zeldas and Fallouts and other standouts, however.
My favorite video game is [Left 4 Dead 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_4_Dead_2) and I'd kill for a sequel to that franchise.

**On a personal note** I strive to be fun-loving, helpful, and friendly. I regret that my precious hobby has become tainted by online cruelty and abuse. I encourage 
behavior that reminds us that gaming is fun and that *everyone* is welcome to the experience.

My best to you,  
Sean Barton
